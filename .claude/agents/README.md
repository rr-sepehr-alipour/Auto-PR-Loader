# Claude Code Agents

This directory contains custom agents for Claude Code that can be invoked to handle specialized tasks.

## What are Agents?

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be launched by Claude Code to perform specific workflows autonomously. Each agent has a defined scope, expertise, and step-by-step process for completing its designated tasks.

## Available Agents

## Creating New Agents

To create a new agent:
1. Type `/agents` in Claude Code
2. Select "Create a new agent"
3. Follow the prompts to define your agent's purpose and workflow

Simply describe what you want your agent to do, and Claude will automatically generate the proper agent file with all necessary components including front matter, workflow instructions, and usage examples.

See existing agent files for reference.
